# Build A Laravel App With TDD
It's time to take the techniques we learned in Laravel From Scratch, and put them to good use building your first real-world application. Together, we'll leverage TDD to create Birdboard: a minimal Basecamp-like project management app.

This series will give us a wide range of opportunities to pull up our sleeves and test our Laravel chops. As always, we start from scratch: `laravel new birdboard`.

## 1. Meet Birdboard

Let's begin by reviewing the application that we plan to build. We'll then finish up by installing Laravel and performing the first commit.
